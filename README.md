# 👋 Hi, I’m @Phantasrn!  
My name is Igor, and I’m passionate about studying systems, logic, and solving real-world problems with their help. 

## 👀 I’m interested in:  
- Mathematics, physics, logic, and logical systems,  
  as well as applying them to solve practical problems and programming.  

## 🌱 Currently, I’m learning:  
- I’ve completed online courses in **C#** and **Python**  
  and continue learning these programming languages.  
- I’m also studying mathematics and physics to expand my knowledge and understanding of the world,  
  as well as to apply this knowledge in practice and programming.  

## 💞️ I’m open to collaboration:  
- I’m ready to assist with any **C#** or **Python** projects to gain practical experience.  

## 📫 How to reach me:  
- Email: [Your email here].  

## ⚡ A few facts about me:  
- I enjoy understanding systems and finding ways to optimize or improve them.  
- One of my strengths is identifying gaps in my knowledge and quickly filling them using open sources and GPT.

Thanks for stopping by! 🚀  

## How I discovered programming:  
In the game **Barotrauma**, I played as an engineer,  
which gave me the opportunity to create logical systems and schematics for various tasks:  
from simple logics for opening doors and saving energy to more complex systems,  
such as submarine self-destruction with authorization and confirmation.  

Later, I created an account system with journals and logs for crew members.  
At some point, I realized that the game mechanics were limiting my ideas,  
and that’s what led me to programming, to implement more complex and flexible solutions.
